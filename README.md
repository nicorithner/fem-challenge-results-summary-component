## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Figma, as design source

### What I learned

As of the time of making this project, I'm still new to styled-components. There was a lot researching on how to apply to this project. I tried to keep everything modular and I chose to abstract the styles to their own file - instead of keeping it withing the component's file.



### Continued development

I may comeback to this project to add tests.
